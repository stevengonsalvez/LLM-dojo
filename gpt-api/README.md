# Introduction to LLM

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and a slide deck that cover Part 1 of an introduction to large language models (LLMs).

## Slide Deck

The [slide deck](../training/building-with-llms-and-chatgpt-api/README.md) provides an overview of the following topics related to LLMs:

- How LLMs work
  - Training using word prediction
  - Base LLM vs instruction-tuned LLMs
- Tokens  
- Prompting
  - Role-based conversations
  - Temperature
- Building systems
  - Classification
  - Moderation
- Chain of thought reasoning  
- Chaining prompts
- Output validation


## Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks provide hands-on examples for exploring concepts covered in the slide deck:

- [HLW-1.ipynb](./HLW-1.ipynb): Getting started with an LLM API, exploring tokens
- [HLW-2.ipynb](./HLW-2.ipynb): Classification for building systems with an LLM
- [HLW-3.ipynb](./HLW-3.ipynb): Moderation and avoiding prompt injection
- [HLW-4.ipynb](./HLW-4.ipynb): Introduction to prompting (Chain of thought reasoning)
- [HLW-5.ipynb](./HLW-5.ipynb): Chaining prompts
- [HLW-6.ipynb](./HLW-6.ipynb): Output validations

The notebooks allow you to experiment with sample prompts and model responses using the OPENAI GPT APIs. 

## Overview

Together, the slide deck and notebooks aim to provide an introduction to key concepts for working with LLMs and building practical systems leveraging their capabilities. The concepts explored lay the foundation for more advanced techniques covered in later parts.
